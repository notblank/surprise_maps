The density of crimes (Fig. \ref{fig:canadadensity}) in the southern provinces suggest that they are less safe; however, this is due to the much larger populations in those provinces. Normalizing to a per-capita rate (Fig. \ref{fig:canadarate}) gives the opposite impression. A Surprise Map (Fig. \ref{fig:canadasurprise}), using both population density and a de Moivre funnel as models, finds the provinces that stick out: Ontario and Quebec have crime rates lower than expected given their population. The seemingly high per-capita rates in Nunavut accord with the higher variability that can arise from a smaller population. }

 	Changes in beliefs about spatial models leading to surprise. Here the events are sampled from a Gaussian distribution, and there are two proposed spatial models of events: a Gaussian (in this case, the correct model), and a uniform model. Initially, both models are equiprobable. However, as more events are processed, modes that are in keeping with a Gaussian model (but would be unlikely in a uniform model), adjust the modal beliefs in favor of the Gaussian model (causing surprise). Once the Gaussian model is established as the clear favorite, the surprise of events tapers off, asymptotically approaching 0. Probability histograms range from $[0,1]$, average surprise ranges from $[0,0.01]$ bits.

As sample size increases, variability decreases. Large differences in event rates may be an artifact of sample size. Conversely, small changes in event rate can be unexpected in high population regions. Some interesting counties (where $P(D|M)$ are low) are Imperial County, CA, which has a somewhat low population, but a high unemployment rate (30\%), and LA County, CA, which has an unemployment rate that is not much higher than the national average (12.7\%, versus an 8.7\% average), but is so populous that its higher rate is notable. Color encodes the unemployment rate, $[0,30\%]$.

As such, the Surprise Map highlights deviations from the Gaussian model, in this case the red spatial outliers. Different model beliefs would produce a different weighting of events.

(a) The counties with high rates of disease appear localized in the great plains region. However, we also see that (b) the counties with the lowest rates are also mostly located in this region. In fact, the data were generated from a Poisson process with a .1\% chance of infection for each citizen, regardless of location. The apparent geographic patterns are an artifact of (c) the high variance in counties with low population.

Down-weighting sparse counties with high variance, the Surprise Map shows robustly high unemployment in the Los Angeles and the Detroit metro areas. The Washington D.C. metro area has surprisingly low unemployment, perhaps due to the many jobs provided by the Federal government and related agencies.

The normalized rate map allows analysts to better distinguish intra-species patterns, but hides deviations from seasonal patterns, such as the uncommonly low death rate of Small Alcids in January (0.15\% of all 2014 Small Alcid deaths): normally, 40.56\% of Small Alcid deaths occur in January.
