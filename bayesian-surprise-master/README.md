# Surprise! Bayesian Weighting for De-Biasing Thematic Maps

This repo contains code and other information for our [paper](Paper/preprint.pdf?raw=true), to be presented at [InfoVis '16](http://ieeevis.org/). 

Surprise Maps use [Bayesian Surprise](http://ilab.usc.edu/surprise/) in order to weight heatmaps and cholorpleth maps in order to highlight unexpected events.

The paper itself, and all relevant figures, are available in the [Paper](Paper/) directory.

Sample code for computing surprise maps is available in the [Code](Code/) directory. 

An interactive demo of a sample surprise map is available in the [Demo](Demo/) directory, or running in [github pages](https://uwdata.github.io/bayesian-surprise/Demo/).
